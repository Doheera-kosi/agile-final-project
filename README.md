# Agile-Final-Project

This repository contains the final project for the Agile Development course. The project involves creating a backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. The team will be using ZenHub and GitHub to create a product backlog, refine it, create a sprint plan, and execute a mock sprint. 

## Project Scenario
The team will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, and developer. The product owner will create stories and organize them into a product backlog. The scrum master will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. The developer will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the kanban board in a simulated sprint.

## Stakeholder Requirements
The stakeholders require the following functionality:
- Create a product in the catalog.
- Retrieve a product from the catalog.
- Update a product in the catalog.
- Delete a product from the catalog.
- Like a product in the catalog.
- Dislike a product in the catalog.
- List all products in the catalog.
- Query a subset of products in the catalog.
- Must be hosted in the cloud.
- Must have automation to deploy new changes to the cloud.

## Instructions
The following are the instructional tasks to complete the project:
1. Create a new GitHub repository called "agile-final-project" and ensure that it is public.
2. Create a workspace in ZenHub called "Final Project" linked to the repository.
3. Create an issue template for the new repository.
4. Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in total). Fill in the "As a... I need... So that..." section of the template.
5. Move the issues that represent requirements 7 and 8 into the Icebox.
6. Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog.
7. Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog so that the stories match the requirements above in the order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 5, & 6.
8. Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin "Given... When... Then..." syntax.
9. Create a "technical debt" label.
10. Add labels to all the stories in the Product Backlog of either "enhancement" or "technical debt".
11. Create a sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks, with the name "Sprint 1" in the title, and a sprint goal in the description.
12. Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint by assigning them to the sprint milestone. Assign story points estimates. Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.
13. Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to yourself. Then move this story to the In Progress pipeline.
14. Move the story that you just assigned to yourself to Review/QA. Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog and assign it to yourself. Move it to the In Progress pipeline.
15. Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Move the story from In Progress to Review/QA. Take the next story off the Sprint Backlog, assign it to yourself, and move it to the In Progress pipeline.
16. Move the story that is left in Review/QA to Done. Leave the story that is in the In Progress pipeline where it is. This is the end of the sprint.
17. Ensure that the burndown chart displays correctly.
18. Share the URL of the kanban board for peer review.
